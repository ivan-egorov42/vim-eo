## Configuration

If you use tabs in Vim, it is necessary to set the 'expandtab' option: `:set expandtab` due to compiler specifics. Also, the following line will be useful if you don't want to set this every time you start the Vim:

```
autocmd BufEnter *.eo set ai ts=2 st=2 expandtab
```

You can add it to your `$HOME/.vimrc` configuration file. This will work only with `.eo` files. 

Arguments `ts` and `st` set number of space characters that will be inserted when the tab key is pressed. You can change it as you wish. 

More information by:

  * :help 'tabstop'
  * :help 'shiftwidth'
  * :help 'expandtab'
  * :help 'softtabstop'

If you want to change colors in vim as you wish, you can see the list of highlight groups [here](https://github.com/objectionary/eo-vim/blob/master/syntax/README.md).
